### Welcome to Cecil

Cecil is an ever growing notification platform that can be used for all notification needs. It pairs perfectly with [ntfy](https://ntfy.sh/) - A fantastic program built to send and handle notifications at zero cost - and will assume you're using it throughout these instructions. You're welcome to implement your own notification service but you assume the upkeep with it. 

The intention of this program is to very generically handle any kind of reporting you need. My goal is to keep it very simple, but also provide whatever type of 'module' that might be needed. This is why the code is broken into individual folders. You can utilize only what you need, and it's easy to make adjustments. 

### Deployment

Deployment of any modules is a piece of cake.
